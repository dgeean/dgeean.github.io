title: ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION 
---
Electricity consumption is changed by some major factors. Such as Wind speed, average temperatures, heating degree days, daily sun hours and rainfall.
How much do these factors affect electricity consumption? What role does human behaviour play in this?

Below data are from UK government: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-and-prices-statistical-release-28-may-2020

Before digging into the model, let's see if all the weather factors were any different than the past 18 years.

In terms of wind speed, temperatures, daily sun hours, and heating degree days, there were no outliers for the past 18 years.

How about rainfall?

Rain full in February 2020 was higher than usual.

Other than this, other measurable values were falling into the normal range.

We here took data from 2002 to 2018 as our training dataset. 
Before 2020/02, the consumption is pretty much dominated by the weather. Given similar values as mentioned above, we can make an accurate prediction as you see.

However, the consumption was lower than usual since February.

Conclusion - 

With the tradtional living style, weather has the most control on our daily electricity consumption. When people stop commute from work and school, it did a immense impact on our electricity usage.
